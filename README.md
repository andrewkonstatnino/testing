# Herculean Technologies Website

## Upload And Deploy

1. Upload the contents of this package to the root of the GitHub repository.
2. Commit the files to the `main` branch.
3. Open **Settings → Pages** in GitHub.
4. Set the Pages source to **GitHub Actions**.

The included workflow deploys the root website automatically whenever `main` is updated.

All website images use relative JPEG paths, allowing them to load from both a project GitHub Pages URL and a custom domain.

The lead form opens a pre-addressed email to `sales@herculeantechnologies.com` because GitHub Pages cannot run server-side email code. This gives visitors a direct send path without requiring a backend service.
